windows.wndstory.sewers=The Dungeon lies right beneath the City, its upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more dangerous. The city sends guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above, but they are slowly failing.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
windows.wndstory.sewers_a=Umgh...\n\nWhere am I?\nWhat i'm doing here?\n\nOh, my head hurts...
windows.wndstory.prison=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
windows.wndstory.prison_a=Oh, it was terrible...\nFinally those sewers ended...\n\nAnd where am I now? Looks like a some kind of prison...\nThat's makes no sense! Who would build prison under sewers?!?
windows.wndstory.caves=The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparcely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
windows.wndstory.caves_a=That assassin was really crazy, and he used some kind of magic...\n\nI think that I must go deeper, I don't know why, but something is telling me that my destiny is awaiting deeper in those strange caves!
windows.wndstory.city=Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of dwarven city-states. In its heyday the mechanized army of dwarves has successfully repelled the invasion of the old god and his demon army. But it is said, that the returning warriors have brought seeds of corruption with them, and that victory was the beginning of the end for the underground kingdom.
windows.wndstory.city_a=How could so strange machines ever exist?\nOh, in any case I destroyed it!\n\nHuh? Caves has ended?\nAnd what is this place? All those strange wires and lamps...
windows.wndstory.halls=In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls.\n\nVery few adventurers have ever descended this far...
windows.wndstory.halls_a=I... I don't know what to thing about this place!\nDwarf City beneath the Caves that lies under Prison that can be accessed through Sewers...\n\nVoices in my head says that my goal is near!\nBut I can feel very strong power emanates from depths!
